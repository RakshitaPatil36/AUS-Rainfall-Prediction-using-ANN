# AUS-Rainfall-Prediction-using-ANN

Applied concepts of Artificial Neural Network to build a model which would predict weather Rainfall will occur the next day or not.

Performed imputations on dataset with 145460 observations with missing data.

Employed Deep Artificial Neural networks on the data after standardizing data and performed SMOTE to handle imbalanced data.

Model achieved 82 % accuarcy of predicting wether rainfall is likely to happen or not.
